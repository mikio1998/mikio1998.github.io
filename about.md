My name is Mikio Nakata, a third year university student in Tokyo studying economics and an aspiring Software developer. 

When I am not at school, I am following my passion for technology by developing native iOS apps. I also like [coding challenges](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) and blockchain. Otherwise, I like traveling the road on my bicycle.  

My recent project is an accounting/inventory tool that I developed for a clothing store I work at as a regular employee. [Please find my projects here.](https://mikio1998.github.io/apps/)
