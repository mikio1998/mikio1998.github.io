My name is Mikio Nakata, a third year university student in Tokyo studying economics and an aspiring Software developer. 

I enjoy developing iOS apps, and doing outdoor things such as riding my bicycle.

My recent project is a simple accounting/inventory tool that I developed for a clothing store I work at.
