For about 2-3 weeks now, I've been learning React (almost everyday) through an online course. 

Compared to Swift, building applications in React is extremely fast due to a powerful library that processes your simple JSX code into 
native browser-readable JavaScript. React embraces what's called component-based development by dividing and conquering your projects into 
building blocks. Components can be recycled and contained in other components, take and pass data through properties, as well as storing a state 
that is entirely up to you to determine how to acquire. Compared to when I learned about delegates and protocols in Swift, it's awesome to already 
get a grasp of passing data this early in my learning. 

What is commonly said about React, and something I assume I'll learn sooner or later, is that while React is simple and develops extremely fast, 
in the long run it won't outperfom the depth of native development. However this is just the nature of things that comes with great benefits such as not having to re-invent the wheel from scratch, and situational on the size of whatever project you have in mind.
