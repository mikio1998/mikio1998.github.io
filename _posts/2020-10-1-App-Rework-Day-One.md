title: App Rework Day One

On the first day, I decided to start on the collection view that will be the products navigator/manual. I will use xib to design the cells I will use in my project. I also keep my project organized using better constants.

<h3>What Iâ€™m doing differently:</h3>
Xib files for cells.
MVP structure for this project.
Constants are kept much safer and organized.

<h5>Cells</h5>
Each cell has a product name and image. 
(Pic of xib) .
```swift
// xib code
```

<h5>Collection</h5>
The collection will have 2 cells per row, with a brand title at the top. 
```swift
// view code
```

<h5>Constants</h5>
For structure, I am keeping central information such as identifiers, keys, paths, and values in a struct.
(Picture of constants.swift)
```swift
// const code
```
In the sub struct ObjectSizes, I decided to keep object sizes and sizing logic in Constants. The reason is because I was struggling to display proportional cells in my collection view. So, I made cell size a constant and applied them both to the cell itself and the collection view layout sizeforitemat.

There must be a better method to this which I will find later.
