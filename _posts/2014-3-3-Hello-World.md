My name is Mikio Nakata, a third year university student in Japan studying economics, and an aspiring Software developer.

About me:

When I am not at school, I am following my passion for invention and technology by developing native iOS apps. I also like (coding challenges) and blockchain. Otherwise, I like traveling the road on my bicycle.

My favorite passion project is an accounting/inventory tool that I developed for a clothing store I work at as a regular employee. (Please read about it here.)

With permission I established a Firestore database for the store's inventory.
